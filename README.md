ERRORS
======

`HTTP::UserAgent` module is used with exception throwing enabled. So exceptions will be thrown in case of non-existent resources, out of range values, etc. See [http://modules.perl6.org/dist/HTTP::UserAgent](http://modules.perl6.org/dist/HTTP::UserAgent).

When an exception of type `X::HTTP::Response` is caught, and the response received from themoviedb.org contains an error message, an attribute named `tmdb_status_message` or `tmdb_errors` will be added to the exception containing that error message.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

Some live tests will run when `NETWORK_TESTING` environment variable is set.
